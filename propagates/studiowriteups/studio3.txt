Part A

What are three data types that can serve as T?
int, double, float

Which class did you pick to examine its compareTo method?
Int

How did its compareTo method impose a natural order on that class's instances?
It assigns "this" to an integer (thisVal) and assigns the input to anotherVal.

Part B

How does compareTo work?  Does it always return either -1, 0, or +1?
It compares the size of each interger value, and uses -1, 0, or 1 to determine if it is greater than, equal to, or less than the other integer.


Part C

From your inspection of the LinkedList<T> class's source code:
Given a LinkedList<T> of size n, what is the asymptotic complexity, worst-case, 
for performing each of the following operations?

  1)  Appending to the end of that list  addLast(..)
  n
  
  2)  Prepending to the beginning of that list   addFirst(...)
  n
  
  3)  Inserting an element in the middle of the list  add(size/2, .....)
  n
  
And for your implementation of a PriorityQueue using the Unordered List, 
given n elements already in the queue, what is the asymptotic complexity, 
worst-case for performing each of the following operations?
  
  4)  extractMin
  n
  
  5)  insert
  constant
  
  6)  isEmpty
  constant
  
  
  
Part D

From your implementation of OrderedArray, what is the asymptotic complexity, worst-case, for performing each of the following operations?

  1)  Adding an element at the end of the array
  
  
  2)  Inserting an element at the beginning of the array
  
  
  3)  Inserting an element in the middle of the list

And for your implementation of a PriorityQueue using the Ordered Array, 
given n elements already in the queue, what is the asymptotic complexity, 
worst-case for performing each of the following operations?
  
  4)  extractMin
  
  5)  insert
  
  6)  isEmpty
  
 
 Are there situations when you would want to use the OrderedArray or the UnorderedList instead of
 the binary heap described in class?   Explain please.
