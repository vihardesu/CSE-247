Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Part A

What are the exact, closed-form formulas for the ticker counts in:

	ProbA?   n - 1  (I'm giving you this answer, make sure it agrees with what you saw)

	ProbB?   sum from 1 to n-1; i

	ProbC?   sum from 1 to n; i

	ProbD? 	 sum from 1 to n; i^2 

	ProbE?	 sum from 1 to n; (i^2)-1


Part B

1.  c =   1      n0 = 1
2.  c =  1000    n0 = 1
3.  c =   4      n0 = 1

Part C

1. 5000 = O(n^2)
 c =  1      n0 = 75 

2. n = O(an+b)
 c =  (1/a) + 1    n0 = -b(1+a) / a^2
 
Part D

an+b = O(n)
c =  	a + 1	   n0 = b + 1

Part E
1. when n is large, function f will be bigger because it'll be the same number of terms as the factornial except they will all b n's instead of 1 -> n
2. function f exponentials will always dominate powers 
3. any polynomial will be bigger than any log.
