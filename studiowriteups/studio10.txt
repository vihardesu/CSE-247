Part A

A1. Why do sad and happy appear as they do? Why is happy indented? What are the parent, left-child, and right-child relationships between happy and sad?

Modify the code in the main method so that some string appears above sad, indented as much as happy.

A2. What string did you use?

In the numbers that follow, find the first and last entries in the tree that is shown (on its side, as discussed in lecture).

A3. Is the first number always the first line to be shown in such a display?

A4. Is the last number always the last line to be shown?

A5. Why do we need addHelper?

A6. Why is it private instead of public?

A7. Does the code actually remove the node containing the value to be removed? If not, what is actually happening?

A8. Why does the code fail to execute properly?

A9. Why does eclipse not report a problem when you try to create a BST of type Color?


Part B


SortedSetUsingBST (random input)

B1. What behavior do you see in the output? You will likely have to rely on ticks rather than time, because the times are so fast.

B2. What behavior did you expect to see, and why?


SortedSetUsingBST (sorted input)

B3. What behavior do you see in the output given the sorted input?

B4. What behavior did you expect to see, and why?

SortedSetUsingUnorderedList

B5. What behavior do you see in the output when a sorted set is implemented by an unordered list? Adding to the list should be quick, so why are we seeing these times?

B6. What behavior did you expect to see, and why?
