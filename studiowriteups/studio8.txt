What distribution do you see plotted (in the histogram or an XY Scatter plot) for Color hashcodes?



If the distribution were not uniform, what would the plot look like?

How many Color objects are added to the set?

How many objects are contained in the set after all Color objects are added?

Why are the above two numbers different?





Are the Point objects' hash values distributed uniformly?


How many Point objects are added to the set?


How many Point objects are in the set after all Point objects are added?


What is wrong with this result?

Based on the code you see in Point, how is equality determined between two Point objects?


Looking at the output in the console window, how does the implementation of hashCode() for Point explain the bad behavior in the set of Points?


How well does your hash function fare in terms of uniformly distributed hash values for the random point objects?



As a team, try out some ideas for Pancake's hashCode() implementation. Record your best idea in the studio8.txt file (here!):


Based on the hashCode() implementation shown to you on the web page, answer the following questions:

If two Pancake objects equal each other, will they get the same hashCode() results?

How good of a job does the implementation do of obtaining uniform distributions of hashCode() values for two Pancake objects that do not equal each other?



Just by inspection of the hashCode() method on the web page, state two Pancakes that are different yet have the same hashCode() value.


Your best hashCode() for Pancake (paste the method here please):





Do your hashCode() values for Pancake appear to be uniformly distributed?




Your implementation of Syrup's hashCode() -- paste here:







How uniformly distributed are your Syrup hashCode() values?



How uniformly distributed are your PancakeAndSyrup hashCode() values?
