Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Part A

What do you see in the plots for ticks and time?

How would you characterize those curves?

Based on the current code for addLast, why do you see this behavior?

Part B

What behavior do you see now for appending n items to a list if you use a tail reference?

While we have reasoned so far only about time, if we are adding n elements to the end of a list, what is the asymptotic complexity of the additional space required when using the tail reference?

Under what conditions would you recommend using a linked list with a tail reference vs. a linked list without at tail reference?

Part C

Why does getSize() take the time it does?

How did you achieve Î˜(1) performance for getSize()?
